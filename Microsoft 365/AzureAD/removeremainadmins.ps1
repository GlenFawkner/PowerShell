&amp;lt;# This script will use the admin users created by the first script to enable the Unified Audit Log in each tenant. If enabling the Unified Audit Log is successful, it'll remove the created admin. If it's not successful, it'll keep the admin in place and add it to another CSV. You can retry these tenants by modifying the $Customers value to import the RemainingAdminsCsv in the next run. #&amp;gt;

$RemainingAdmins = import-csv "C:\temp\RemainingAdmins.csv"
 
# This CSV will contain a list of all admins removed by this script.
